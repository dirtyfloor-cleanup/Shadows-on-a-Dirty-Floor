## Mission: Establish the Democratic Federal policy vision for healthcare.

## ##
## Requirements: ##
# Make insurance cheaper and less complicated for small businesses owners.
# Medicaid for all. No means tests. You can opt out if its too communisty for you.
# Reproductive Rights, Unborn, and Abortion
    # Women should have time to learn their options and make decisions from moment they are aware they are pregnant.
    # Post birth abortions is not a thing that happens and obviously not a thing we support, 
        # but we have to mention it because Fox News wants you to think Democrats abort children 
        # after birth and I've met people that believe it.
    # Women should not have to traverse state lines to get care due to local or state laws. 
        # Policy should be at National level.
    # Women should not be considered a criminal for traversing state lines for healthcare or to
        # exercise their reproductive rights.

Policy recommendation:
