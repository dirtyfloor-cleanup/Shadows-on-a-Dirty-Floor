## What do we do?

### Collaborate: Policies People Want
#We have no power
#We cast our ideas onto the dirty floor
#Collaborate with us to push real policy that people want

### Prioritize: Focus on Highest Value Policy
#We prioritize these policies
#We focus on the critical needs with alignment across the party
#Policies must be valuable to the largest groups. We start there. No niche bullshit.

### Rebuild: the Democratic Party
#Ignore the noise. 
#Policies that aren't popular or valuable go away.
#Is your policy purely antithesis of Republican policy? Go away.
#Revenge policy must go away.
#Ignore the noise.
