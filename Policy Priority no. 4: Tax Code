## Mission: Simplify the tax codes

## ##
## Requirements ##
# Taxes should be easier to calculate.
# People want equitable taxes.
    #This means, I pay 20%, you pay 20%.
    #Less offsets, less exemptions, less arbitrary means tests.
        #I know you policy gurus hate this because of math, but your theories
        #are not winning elections. Simple ideals will though. Follow the feels!
    #You don't get exempted because you only work part time;
        #and billionaire doesn't get exemption for yaght purchase.
# We pity billionaires because the on paper % of taxes is "higher" than their tax rate, but the actual 
    #amount they pay in taxes is not that. We are giving them *credit* for an assumed dollar figure
    #they are not actually paying. Look at the numbers.
## ##

# Ignore the bellyaching. People whine about taxes when the aggregate of all the taxes they pay
# from property tax, to income tax, state tax, sales tax, inheritance, capital gains, all these
# taxes that someone pays feels like so much, but I guarantee you, what you pay in total taxes
# doesn't even cover the cost to repave and fill the pot holes on the road in front of your house.
# so for the love of god quit your bellyaching over how much you pay in taxes.


### Policy Recommendation: Tax Code ###

# Everyone pays 20%. No funky exemptions, offsets, or means tests.
