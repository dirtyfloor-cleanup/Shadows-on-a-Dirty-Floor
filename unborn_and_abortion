Mission: Establish the Democratic Federal policy vision for abortion care and the unborn.

Requirements:
#1 Women should have time to make decisions from moment they are aware they are pregnant.
#2 Post birth abortions is not a thing that happens and obviously not a thing we support, but we have to 
  #mention it because Fox News wants you to think Democrats abort children after birth and I've met people that believe it.
#3 Women should not have to traverse state lines to get care due to local or state laws. Policy should be at National level.
#4 Women should not be considered a criminal for traversing state lines.

Policy recommendation: 
#1 Codify Roe vs Wade
